# tweetRater
This aims to rate tweets based on how well they are received and also how factual/opinionated they are.

tweetRater aims to make it easier to harvest data from twitter and place it within a csv file.
The main point of this is to make data harvesting from twitter easier and also it was a side project my friend put me up to.

This is supposed to be run with in python.

I hope to eventually finish of my GUI and make it a finished application.
